NAME
       notmuch-address-cache  -  caches  the  result  from notmuch-address and
       search within this cached version.


SYNOPSIS
       notmuch-address-cache [ COMMAND ] [ ARG ]


DESCRIPTION
       notmuch-address-cache is basically a cache in  front  of  the  notmuch-
       address command.

       notmuch-address-cache caches all sender and recipients you communicated
       with.


Commands
       help, --help, -h
              Show help text.

       version, --version, -v
              Show the version.

       rebuild, --rebuild, -r [--json | --text]
              Uses notmuch-address to find all sender/recipient  you  communi-
              cated  with  and  print them out to the file ~/.notmuch-address-
              cache/addresses. The format of the cached addresses  are  stored
              in  json, if you rebuild your cache with option --json. The for-
              mat of the cached addresses are stored in text, if  you  rebuild
              your  cache with option--text. Format text is recommended if you
              want to query the cache with mutt. Format json is recommended if
              you want to query the cache with alot.

       update, --update, -u [--json | --text]
              Uses  notmuch-address to find all sender/recipient, based on the
              tag:new, you communicated with and prepend them out to the  file
              ~/.notmuch-address-cache/addresses.  It  expect  the notmuch tag
              tag:new on all messages to extract  the  sender  and  recipients
              from  there.  You  can configure notmuch to apply the tag:new to
              all messages. This is  basically  done  if  you  edit  the  file
              ~/.notmuch-config,  go  into section [new] and add the value new
              to  the  key  tags.  For  more  details   see   https://notmuch-
              mail.org/initial_tagging/ in section 'The new tag approach'. The
              format of the cached addresses are stored in json, if you update
              your  cache  with  option  --json.  The  format  of  the  cached
              addresses are stored in text, if  you  update  your  cache  with
              option --text.

       query, --query, -q
              Greps the cache file for the given query. Interpret the query as
              an extended regular expression. Perform case  insesitive  match-
              ing.
